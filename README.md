Acids
========

The IT asset management application programmable interface (API) Asterisk for Java.

Description
-----------

Acids is an IT asset management (ITAM) interface available on Github that lets you add assets to a mysql relational database. Organizations often lack visibility of IT assetsâ€™ locations, and the users that use them. This lack of visibility can lead to hardware assets being lost or stolen without anyone being held accountable.

The application that I will be developing will be an application programmable interface (API) for an IT asset management (ITAM), this will improve the visibility and accountability of hardware IT assets in an organization.
