Yet another Asset Management System (Yams)
========

The IT asset management application programmable interface (API) Asterisk for Java.

Description
-----------

Acids is an IT asset management (ITAM) interface available on Github that lets you add assets to a mysql relational database. Organizations often lack visibility of IT assetsâ€™ locations, and the users that use them. This lack of visibility can lead to hardware assets being lost or stolen without anyone being held accountable.

The application that I will be developing will be an application programmable interface (API) for an IT asset management (ITAM), this will improve the visibility and accountability of hardware IT assets in an organization.

# Todo
Devide the classes into 

## Value objects
+ Asset
+ User
+ Customer
+ Staff

## Entities
### Asset
+ id
+ name
 

Not all classes are value objects
Entities don't usually have Id's
Generate Hash for Values objects, this is used to uniquly identify objects by them.
You'll also implement comparable<class> in the repository.


## For example
### Student - Class is a value object
private Name name = NameFactory.getName();

### Name - Class is a Entity
+ firstname
+ lastName

Contact
+ Address
+ Phone


Link them using composition
